# Apache Directory List Example

_Note_: this uses only local files for running on devices without internet
connectivity.

To utilise this Apache directory list replacement, you'll need to have your own
server set up and configured with WevDAV (hopefully that's a given!).

Clone this repository to a desirable location (eg. `/srv/webdav-js`) then modify
the example `webdav.conf` file to your liking, updating the references to the
`webdav-js` repo if you've checked it out elsewhere.

From then on you should be able to upload and browse at your leisure.
